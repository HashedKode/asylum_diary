I hope my previous post have my worries conveyed. (More than one, though they are of the same nature.) Watch out for yourselves.

The way I wrote "Nothing special" yesterday has me think about a question I (and probably many other people) wondered, "How are the oppressed living like nothing is wrong? Maybe things are not really that bad there?" I know the answer now. It is not that nothing is wrong. It is more like you do not know if there is anything that is not wrong. You don't know what to trust.

Though it should be obvious, I will make it clear:
Nothing special was refering to the fact that the same shits have happened for quite some time already. At least since months before I left my homeland.
The "Nothing special" is actually very sick. It includes (but not limited to):
Surveillance:
What I do on my devices, including offline activities, including what I write here.
What I do physically.
Recording:  (It's part of the surveillace, but let's make it explicit.)
What I do. What I say. Probably also what I write here. And then it is shared by the whole bunch of assholes. And the fanciest part? Not a single darn soul feels bothered by the privacy violation and harassments that follow.
Simliar thing like this happened when I was studying. I mentioned it when I was talking to some teacher, and I was told to be careful and not to tell the others. I thought it was just some people doing it for fun, although I didn't find it funny at all.
Pestering:
Pester me with what they believe will upset me.
Pester me with exactly what I said I don't like.
Keep repeating some things as though wanting me to echo.

Oh, I am upset, but not for the words. I am upset for how sick this world is.

The day is yet to begin, let's see what there will be today.
